This is a project to introduce data. The main purpose of this project is to study the temperature changes in EstesPark during the month of May 2006. The data extracted from the web page tells me that there is a large temperature difference in this month, with a large difference between the maximum and minimum values, and that the standard deviation supports this. All data here is descriptive statistics, such as average temperature, average windspeed etc.
